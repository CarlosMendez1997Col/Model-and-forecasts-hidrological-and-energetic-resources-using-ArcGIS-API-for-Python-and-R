# Models and forecasts in hidrological resources and energy

## Description

Modeling and forecasting in hydrological resources and energy using the `LSTM (long short-term memory)` and `ResCNN` neural networks in ArcGIS for Python and R.

Each section is described below:

* The first section shows the data and files used in the project
* The second and third sections show the script for the LSTM and ResCNN neural networks in the python language
* The fourth section shows the NNAR neural network script for predicting future values in R.

## Prerequisites and libraries

library(readxl)
```

## Data acquisition and download

The LSTM and ResCNN neural networks, used information and time series about Hydroelectric Power Plants (HPP):

* Data
* Useful Volume
* Useful Volume Percent (%)
* Affluent Flow
* Defluent Flow
* Natural Flow
* Stored Energy 
* Affluent Natural Energy
* Energy Generation

Data processed in time series formats are available at: 

* HPP Capivara: [link](https://arcg.is/1u158D) 
* HPP Chavantes: [link](https://arcg.is/1O1Wq11)
