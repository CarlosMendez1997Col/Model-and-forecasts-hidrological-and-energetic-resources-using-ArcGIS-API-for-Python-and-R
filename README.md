# Models and forecasts in hidrological resources and energy

## Description

Modeling and forecasting in hydrological resources and energy using the `LSTM (long short-term memory)` and `ResCNN` neural networks in ArcGIS for Python.

Each section is described below:

1. The first section shows the data and files used in the project
2 and 3. The second and third sections show the script for the LSTM and ResCNN neural networks in the python language
4. The fourth section shows the NNAR neural network script for predicting future values in R.
